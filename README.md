# Create stop motion video from a MIDI-file

This script takes in a MIDI-file, and footage of you playing instruments,
and composes it to a stop motion video, kind of like MysteryGuitarMan did
manually back in 2010. An example of the output when the input was a MIDI
file of Through the Fire and Flames by DragonForce can be found below:
